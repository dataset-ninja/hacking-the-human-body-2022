**Hacking the Human Body 2022** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the biological research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 352 images with 351 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *kidney*, *prostate*, *largeintestine*, and other: *spleen* and *lung*.

Images in the Hacking the Human Body 2022 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (351 images) and *test* (1 images). Also, the dataset includes ***age***, ***sex***, ***tissue_thickness*** for train split, ***organ*** and ***tissue_thickness*** for test split. The dataset was released in 2022.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
